# TeamSpeak3_Banlist
Teamspeak3 Banlist with Administration in TeamSpeak 3 PHP Framework.

Graphically Designed by [DAWE Graphics](https://github.com/DV2013DAWE).

### Tutorial
* Edit the data in */cfg/config.ini*
* Import files with folders into your web server's storage
* Folder *cfg* must be placed under the folder in which the banlist. For example, the site will be in */var/www/banlist/* so the contents of the cfg must be in the */var/www/cfg/* (Safety reasons!)
***
### Next release

* Delete/Add bans
* More information for each record
* I recommend using a newer version! [All Version](https://github.com/ArrayMy/TeamSpeak3_Banlist/releases)
